# Reimbursement-of-hospital-bills-for-government-employee

<b>ABSTRACT:</b>\
The various schemes and facilities provided by the government to the government employees are very beneficial. However, availing these facilities requires a long and tedious process. The facility we focused on is the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS). This scheme provides comprehensive medical care to the Central Government employees and pensioners enrolled under the scheme. We aim to make a small aspect of this scheme more easily accessible to the employees. We created a website for the central government employees which provides an online form for reimbursement of their hospital bills and for memo requests.\
The features of our website are:\
1)Memo Request Form\
2)Reimbursement of Bills\
3)Check Availability of Medicines
